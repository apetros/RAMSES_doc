Welcome to RAMSES documentation!

.. _start_installing-runtime-libraries:

Installing runtime libraries
============================

The simulator depends on the Intel redistributable libraries. You can install
the runtime libraries for your system from `Intel <https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intelr-composer-redistributable-libraries-by-version>`_.

At the current version PyRAMSES version, you should select for Windows::

   Parallel Studio XE 2015 (all Editions) ->
   Redistributable libraries of Intel® Fortran Compiler for Windows ->
   Update 2

or for Linux::

   Parallel Studio XE 2015 (all Editions) ->
   Redistributable libraries of Intel® Fortran Compiler for Linux ->
   Update 2

Alternatively, you can install Anaconda Python which come with MKL library installed.

.. _start_install_gnuplot:

Installing Gnuplot
==================

To display the runtime observables, gnuplot should be installed and available in the path. You can install
gnuplot from `the official website <http://www.gnuplot.info/>`_.

Under Linux, you can install with your package manager. For example, under Ubuntu or Debian:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install gnuplot-x11
