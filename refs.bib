abstract={The optimal control of distribution networks often requires monitoring and communication infrastructure, either centralized or distributed. However, most of the current distribution systems lack this kind of infrastructure and rely on sub-optimal, fit-and-forget, local controls to ensure the security of the network. In this paper, we propose a data-driven algorithm that uses historical data, advanced optimization techniques, and machine learning methods, to design local controls that emulate the optimal behavior without the use of any communication. We demonstrate the performance of the optimized local control on a three-phase, unbalanced, low-voltage, distribution network. The results show that our data-driven methodology clearly outperforms standard industry local control and successfully imitates an optimal-power-flow-based control.},

   abstract = {The cyber-physical nature of electric power systems has increased immensely over the past decades, with advanced communication infrastructure paving the way. It is now possible to design wide-area controllers, relying on remote monitor and control of devices that can tackle power system stability problems more effectively than local controllers. However, their performance and security relies extensively on the communication infrastructure and can make power systems vulnerable to disturbances emerging on the cyber side of the system. In this study, the authors investigate the effect of communication delays on the performance of wide-area damping controllers designed to stabilise oscillatory modes in a cyber-physical power system (CPPS). They propose a rule-based control strategy that combines wide-area and traditional local stabilising controllers to increase the performance and maintain the stable operation of CPPS. The proposed strategy is validated on a reduced CPPS equivalent model of Great Britain.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel virtual synchronous machine controller for converters in power systems with a high share of renewable resources. Using an LQR-based optimization technique, the optimal state feedback gain is determined to adaptively adjust the emulated inertia and damping constants according to the frequency disturbance in the system, while simultaneously preserving a trade-off between the critical frequency limits and the required control effort. Two control designs are presented and compared against the open-loop model. The proposed controllers are integrated into a state-of-the-art converter control scheme and verified through EMT simulations.},

Abstract                 = {Dynamic simulations have played an important role in assessing the power system dynamic studies. The appropriate numerical model is the key to obtain correct dynamic simulation results. In addition, the appropriate model including the selection of the individual model component (such as protections, controls and capabilities) is different depending on the type of phenomena to be observed or examined. However, the proper selection of the model is not an easy task especially for Inverter Based Generators (IBGs). Considerable industry experience concerning power system dynamic studies and the dynamics of the IBGs is required for the proper selection of the IBG model. The established CIGRE C4/C6.35/CIRED Joint Working Group (JWG) has gathered a wide variety of experts which fully cover the required industry experience. The JWG provides the guidance on the model selection for analyzing the phenomena such as frequency deviation, large voltage deviation, and long-term voltage deviation, individually. This helps to reduce the computational burden as well as it clarifies the required characteristics/functions that should be represented for the power system dynamic studies with the IBGs.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates the planning and operational processes of modern distribution networks hosting distributed energy resources (DERs). While in the past the two aspects have been distinct, a methodology is proposed in this paper to co-optimise the two phases by considering the operational flexibility offered by DERs already in the planning phase. By employing AC optimal power flow (OPF) to analyse the worst-case scenarios for the load and distributed generator injection, the optimal set-points for the DERs are determined such that the network's security is ensured. From these results, the optimised individual characteristic curves are then extracted for each DER which are used in the operational phase for the local control of the devices. The optimised controls use only local measurements to address system-wide issues and emulate the OPF solution without any communication. Finally, the proposed methodology is tested on the Cigre LV benchmark grid confirming that it is successful in mitigating with acceptable violations over- and under-voltage problems, as well as congestion issues. Its performance is compared against the OPF-based approach and currently employed local control schemes.},

In addition, due to the Schur-complement approach used to update the sub-domain interface variables, the algorithm exhibits high global convergence rate. Finally, it provides significant numerical and computational acceleration. The algorithm is implemented using the shared-memory parallel programming model, targeting inexpensive multi-core machines.

  Abstract                 = {Hydro-Quebec has a long interest in on-line Dynamic Security Assessment (DSA) driven by its challenging system dynamics. Presently, off-line calculated security limits are combined with an on-line monitoring system. However, new developments in dynamic simulation enable real-time or near-real-time DSA calculations and transfer limits determination. In this paper, the domain-decomposition-based algorithm implemented in the simulator RAMSES is presented, along with techniques to accelerate its sequential and parallel executions. RAMSES exploits the localized response to disturbances and the time-scale decomposition of dynamic phenomena to provide sequential acceleration when the simulation is performed on a single processing unit. Additionally, when more units are available, the parallelization potential of domain-decomposition methods is exploited for further acceleration. The algorithm and techniques have been tested on a realistic model of the Hydro-QuÃ©bec system to evaluate the accuracy of dynamic responses and the sequential and parallel performances. Finally, the real-time capabilities have been assessed using a shared-memory parallel processing platform.},

The proposed scheme is model-free and makes use of limited communication between the controllers in the form of a distress signal only during emergency conditions. It prioritizes the use of reactive power, while active power curtailment is performed only as a last resort. The behavior of the scheme is studied using dynamic simulations on a single LV feeder and on a larger network composed of 14 LV feeders. Its performance is compared with a centralized scheme based on the solution of an optimal power flow (OPF) problem, whose objective function is to minimize the active power curtailment. The proposed scheme successfully mitigates overvoltage situations due to high PV penetration and performs almost as well as the OPF-based solution with significantly less information and communication requirements.},
